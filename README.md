## Hi there 👋

### Who am I?

🎓 I’m currently a **Final Year Software Engineering student**, focusing on backend development with **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

### Experience

💻 I have hands-on experience with the **Java/Spring Boot ecosystem**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **Maven/Gradle** build tools. I’m currently diving deep into **Java backend fundamentals**, exploring topics such as **concurrency**, the **AWS ecosystem**, **design patterns**, and **system design**.
💡 I’m also interested in modern engineering practices like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **Specification-Driven Development**.

### Previous Working Experience

🧩 **Ant International (Intern)**

* Built CRUD functionalities using **MyBatis Plus**, **Java 8**, and **SofaBoot**.
* Leveraged **Yunfengdie**, a low-code platform, for frontend development.

🔐 **iFAST Global Hub (Intern)**

* Implemented **OAuth2 authentication** using **Spring Security**, managing **secret keys**, **public/private key pairs**, and **cipher encryption** with Java’s built-in libraries.
* Enhanced the **CI/CD pipeline** by integrating the **Checkstyle plugin** for code quality enforcement.
* Improved **logging consistency** across microservices and threads by implementing **Trace ID** tracking.
* Contributed to the development of utility classes, including creating an `AssertUtils` class for cleaner, more maintainable validation logic.
